# Stealth Aircraft Deep Penetration Scenario
# RadarSim Scientific Edge Case
#
# Purpose: Test frequency-dependent RCS detection (UHF vs X-Band)
# Challenge: B-21 Raider with 0.001 m² RCS at X-Band
#
# Scientific Note: Lower frequencies (UHF) can detect stealth better
# because stealth shaping is optimized for higher frequencies.

# Physics comparison note:
#   At UHF (450 MHz): λ = 0.67m, aircraft dimensions approach resonance
#   At X-Band (10 GHz): λ = 0.03m, stealth shaping very effective
#   Expected: UHF detection at ~200km, X-Band might not detect at all
